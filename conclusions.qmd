Across all analyses, the evidence indicates that daily financial returns are highly unpredictable, but their volatility and short-run interactions follow clear, structured patterns. ARIMA models showed that return dynamics for SP500 and Bitcoin are extremely limited, with only weak autocorrelation and very small cross-asset spillovers. Although the multivariate ARIMAX models detected statistically significant links—for example, equity returns responding weakly to VIX or Bitcoin—the magnitudes were tiny, implying minimal economic spillover in daily return behavior.

Volatility, however, revealed more meaningful structure. GARCH modeling showed pronounced volatility clustering in both SP500 and Bitcoin, but with different regimes: SP500 volatility is slow-moving and highly persistent, while Bitcoin volatility responds sharply to shocks and fades more rapidly. These differences imply asymmetric volatility spillovers, where shocks do not propagate evenly across markets and where cryptocurrencies operate under a noisier, more idiosyncratic volatility process.

Deep learning models improved forecasting modestly. Both univariate and multivariate LSTM/GRU networks stabilized predictions, captured nonlinearities, and outperformed ARIMA, though they still produced smoothed forecasts due to the dominance of noise. Adding macro-financial variables led to small RMSE gains, confirming weak but measurable cross-market influences, yet insufficient to overcome the fundamental unpredictability of returns.

Overall, the results show that return spillovers are weak, volatility spillovers are asymmetric, and forecasting power remains limited across all models. Classical and deep learning methods each reveal different aspects of market behavior: ARIMA captures short-term memory, GARCH models volatility persistence, and deep learning captures nonlinear structure. Together, they demonstrate that while precise return forecasting is infeasible, understanding volatility dynamics and cross-market interactions provides meaningful insights for risk management, stress testing, and short-horizon decision support.

The interrupted time-series analysis shows that the FTX collapse did not create a meaningful structural break in Bitcoin’s daily returns. Both the pre- and post-event trends are nearly flat, regression coefficients for level and slope changes are statistically insignificant, and the distribution of returns remains almost identical before and after the event. While the collapse triggered a brief spike in volatility, Bitcoin quickly reverted to its typical noisy, mean-reverting behavior. This reinforces the broader conclusion: even major news events create only short-lived disturbances, not persistent shifts that improve predictability.
