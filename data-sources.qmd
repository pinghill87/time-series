Data Sources
This project uses daily macro-financial data obtained directly from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API through the R package `quantmod`. All datasets were downloaded programmatically to ensure reproducibility and consistent formatting.

1. Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)
All price and index series used in the analysis come from FRED, including:

| Asset / Variable | FRED Code | Description |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------|
| S&P 500 Index | `SP500` | Daily closing levels of the S&P 500, representing broad U.S. equity market performance. |
| NASDAQ Composite Index | `NASDAQCOM` | Tech-heavy U.S. equity index capturing large-cap and growth-oriented stocks. |
| VIX (CBOE Volatility Index) | `VIXCLS` | Daily closing value of implied volatility ("fear index"). |
| Bitcoin Price (USD) | `CBBTCUSD` | Daily Bitcoin–USD price from FRED's digital asset database. |
| U.S. Dollar Index | `DTWEXBGS` | Nominal broad trade-weighted U.S. Dollar Index. |

These were loaded using:

```
getSymbols(symbol, src = "FRED", from = start_date, to = end_date)
```


1. Preprocessing & Derived Variables
From the raw FRED price levels, the following were constructed:
* Daily log returns:
r_t = log(P_t) - log(P_{t-1})
Used for ARIMA, SARIMA, GARCH, VAR/ARIMAX, and all deep learning models.s
* Merged time-aligned dataset All series were merged by date and `na.omit()` was applied to ensure clean modeling.
* Feature matrices Used in multivariate ARIMAX and deep learning models (SP500, NASDAQ, VIX, USD as predictors).
