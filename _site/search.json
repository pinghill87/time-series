In time-series analysis we study how these values evolve: their level, trend, seasonal or calendar patterns (e.g., weekdays vs. weekends, holiday effects), cycles, and anomalies.

Time-series work must explicitly handle dependence, trend, and seasonality—for example by differencing, seasonal adjustment, and models that use lagged values and errors (e.g., ARIMA/SARIMA, ARIMAX/SARIMAX with external drivers, VAR for multiple series, state-space/ETS, or GARCH when volatility changes over time). Analysts also watch for structural breaks (e.g., policy shifts, COVID), outliers, and missing periods, and they evaluate models with time-aware validation (rolling or blocked splits) rather than random shuffles."

    "section": "Foundational Spillover Methodology and Traditional Markets",
    "text": "Foundational Spillover Methodology and Traditional Markets\nThe measurement of volatility spillovers has been revolutionized by the work of Diebold and Yilmaz (2012), who developed a generalized vector autoregressive framework in which forecast-error variance decompositions are invariant to variable ordering, enabling measures of both total and directional volatility spillovers. Their analysis of US stock, bond, foreign exchange, and commodities markets from 1999 to 2010 demonstrated that cross-market volatility spillovers were quite limited until the global financial crisis, which began in 2007, with particularly important spillovers from the stock market to other markets taking place after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. This methodology has been extended by Engle (2002) with Dynamic Conditional Correlation models for evolving correlations, and by Baruník and Křehlík (2018), who introduced frequency-domain analysis to distinguish between short-run trader-driven spillovers and long-run fundamental economic relationships. Recent methodological advances include Antonakakis and Gabauer (2017), who refined these measures to capture time-varying connectedness using TVP-VAR methods that provide more dynamic and sensitive connectedness measurements, particularly when relationships in the system do not remain constant over time."

    "section": "Cryptocurrency Integration and Cross-Market Spillovers",
    "text": "Cryptocurrency Integration and Cross-Market Spillovers\nThe emergence of cryptocurrency markets has fundamentally altered the landscape of financial spillovers, with mounting evidence of significant transmission effects to traditional asset classes. Recent studies demonstrate significant adverse volatility spillover effects from the cryptocurrency market to financial markets across various regions, including North America, South America, Europe, and Asia, with shocks originating in the cryptocurrency market negatively impacting stock markets, volatility indices, and foreign exchange rates globally. Research by the International Monetary Fund (2023) reveals that crypto assets predominantly transmit spillovers to financial markets, though reversals occur during periods of financial stress, with the magnitude of spillovers increasing during periods of heightened turbulence due to negative economic-financial news or crypto market events. The COVID-19 pandemic served as a natural experiment, with empirical analysis showing that the pandemic amplified volatility spillovers, thereby intensifying financial contagion between markets, indicating that the pandemic’s impact on the economy heightened risk transmission across markets. Notably, recent Chinese market evidence from 2018-2024 shows that cryptocurrency price volatility causes stock market prices to fluctuate in the same direction while causing gold market prices to fluctuate in the opposite direction, challenging traditional safe-haven assumptions."

    "section": "Crisis Dynamics, Frequency Effects, and Research Gaps",
    "text": "Crisis Dynamics, Frequency Effects, and Research Gaps\nThe literature reveals that spillover relationships exhibit distinct patterns during crisis periods and across different time horizons, highlighting the importance of frequency-domain analysis and time-varying methodologies. Studies show that heightened crude oil volatility, stock volatility, and economic policy uncertainty contribute to more significant liquidity spillovers within cryptocurrency markets, with increased volatility in exchange rates, crude oil, gold, and stock markets enhancing Ethereum’s role as a transmitter of liquidity shocks. Research using DCC-GARCH and wavelet analysis during COVID-19 demonstrates that volatility spillovers in cryptocurrency markets exhibit information inefficiency characteristics, with mutual linkages reflected through volatility co-movement, lead/lag effects, and systematic risk transmission. However, despite these advances, significant gaps remain in the literature. Most existing studies focus on either cryptocurrency-to-crypto spillovers or limited bilateral relationships with specific traditional assets, rather than comprehensive multi-asset class analysis. Additionally, research indicates that extreme fluctuations not predicted by current models are primarily caused by sudden external events, suggesting that existing methods are better suited for early warning of endogenous market volatility rather than exogenous shocks. This project addresses these gaps by providing a systematic analysis of directional spillovers across multiple asset classes while incorporating both crisis-period dynamics and frequency-decomposed effects to better understand the evolving role of cryptocurrencies in global financial stability."
