    "text": "Foundational Spillover Methodology and Traditional Markets\nThe measurement of volatility spillovers has been revolutionized by the work of Diebold and Yilmaz (2012), who developed a generalized vector autoregressive framework in which forecast-error variance decompositions are invariant to variable ordering, enabling measures of both total and directional volatility spillovers. Their analysis of US stock, bond, foreign exchange, and commodities markets from 1999 to 2010 demonstrated that cross-market volatility spillovers were quite limited until the global financial crisis, which began in 2007, with particularly important spillovers from the stock market to other markets taking place after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. This methodology has been extended by Engle (2002) with Dynamic Conditional Correlation models for evolving correlations, and by Baruník and Křehlík (2018), who introduced frequency-domain analysis to distinguish between short-run trader-driven spillovers and long-run fundamental economic relationships. Recent methodological advances include Antonakakis and Gabauer (2017), who refined these measures to capture time-varying connectedness using TVP-VAR methods that provide more dynamic and sensitive connectedness measurements, particularly when relationships in the system do not remain constant over time."

    "text": "Cryptocurrency Integration and Cross-Market Spillovers\nThe emergence of cryptocurrency markets has fundamentally altered the landscape of financial spillovers, with mounting evidence of significant transmission effects to traditional asset classes. Recent studies demonstrate significant adverse volatility spillover effects from the cryptocurrency market to financial markets across various regions, including North America, South America, Europe, and Asia, with shocks originating in the cryptocurrency market negatively impacting stock markets, volatility indices, and foreign exchange rates globally. Research by the International Monetary Fund (2023) reveals that crypto assets predominantly transmit spillovers to financial markets, though reversals occur during periods of financial stress, with the magnitude of spillovers increasing during periods of heightened turbulence due to negative economic-financial news or crypto market events. The COVID-19 pandemic served as a natural experiment, with empirical analysis showing that the pandemic amplified volatility spillovers, thereby intensifying financial contagion between markets, indicating that the pandemic’s impact on the economy heightened risk transmission across markets. Notably, recent Chinese market evidence from 2018-2024 shows that cryptocurrency price volatility causes stock market prices to fluctuate in the same direction while causing gold market prices to fluctuate in the opposite direction, challenging traditional safe-haven assumptions."

    "section": "Crisis Dynamics, Frequency Effects, and Research Gaps",
    "text": "Crisis Dynamics, Frequency Effects, and Research Gaps\nThe literature reveals that spillover relationships exhibit distinct patterns during crisis periods and across different time horizons, highlighting the importance of frequency-domain analysis and time-varying methodologies. Studies show that heightened crude oil volatility, stock volatility, and economic policy uncertainty contribute to more significant liquidity spillovers within cryptocurrency markets, with increased volatility in exchange rates, crude oil, gold, and stock markets enhancing Ethereum’s role as a transmitter of liquidity shocks. Research using DCC-GARCH and wavelet analysis during COVID-19 demonstrates that volatility spillovers in cryptocurrency markets exhibit information inefficiency characteristics, with mutual linkages reflected through volatility co-movement, lead/lag effects, and systematic risk transmission. However, despite these advances, significant gaps remain in the literature. Most existing studies focus on either cryptocurrency-to-crypto spillovers or limited bilateral relationships with specific traditional assets, rather than comprehensive multi-asset class analysis. Additionally, research indicates that extreme fluctuations not predicted by current models are primarily caused by sudden external events, suggesting that existing methods are better suited for early warning of endogenous market volatility rather than exogenous shocks. This project addresses these gaps by providing a systematic analysis of directional spillovers across multiple asset classes while incorporating both crisis-period dynamics and frequency-decomposed effects to better understand the evolving role of cryptocurrencies in global financial stability."

    "text": "Volatility Spillovers Across Asset Classes\nBig Picture Goal\nThis project investigates how major financial markets interact, focusing on whether Bitcoin, the S&P 500, the VIX (fear index), and the U.S. Dollar Index influence each other’s returns and volatility. The goal is to understand whether crypto markets transmit risk to traditional finance or primarily react to it.\nAnalytical Framework\nTo answer the big-picture question, the analysis proceeds through four structured layers:\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n\nI begin by examining long-term price trends, return distributions, rolling volatilities, and pairwise correlations across Bitcoin, S&P 500, NASDAQ, VIX, and USD. Key diagnostic finding: Returns are stationary for all assets (post-differencing), but price levels are not.\n\nUnivariate Modeling (ARIMA / SARIMA)\n\nUsing daily returns, I estimate ARIMA models for each asset to capture their individual dynamics.\nFindings:\nBTC returns ≈ white noise with minimal predictability.\nSP500 and NASDAQ exhibit stronger autocorrelation, supporting ARIMA(2,0,2) and ARIMA(4,0,3).\nVIX is mean-reverting, best captured by ARIMA(3,0,1).\nUSD index behaves almost pure white noise.\nThese models serve as a benchmark for whether multivariate models add value.\n\nMultivariate Modeling (ARIMAX Spillovers)\n\nI then test for return spillovers by regressing each asset’s returns on the others:\nBitcoin is influenced by SP500 returns (positive) and VIX (slightly negative).\nS&P 500 is significantly driven by VIX (strong negative effect) and lightly by Bitcoin.\nVIX responds strongly to SP500 (negative), but barely to BTC.\nUSD shows no meaningful connection to BTC or SP500.\nForecast comparison shows that including other assets slightly improves accuracy, supporting mild cross-market influence.\n\nVolatility Modeling (ARCH–GARCH)\n\nTo analyze volatility clustering:\nSP500 volatility fits ARMA(2,1)–GARCH(2,1) → captures strong persistence and ARCH effects.\nBitcoin volatility fits ARMA(1,0)–GARCH(2,1) → weaker clustering but clear volatility persistence.\nThis framework identifies whether volatility in one market tends to spill into another.\n\nEvent Analysis (Interrupted Time Series – FTX Collapse)\n\nFinally, I examine whether the FTX collapse created a structural break in Bitcoin behavior.\nResult:\nNo statistically significant change in BTC return mean or trend after FTX.\nBTC experienced short-term turbulence, but no long-run shift.\nThis suggests crypto markets absorb shocks quickly, with no persistent transformation in return behavior."

Across the three architectures, the LSTM achieved the lowest RMSE (0.719), followed closely by the GRU (0.721) and then the vanilla RNN (0.727). This performance hierarchy is consistent with the theoretical strengths of each model: LSTMs capture long-term dependencies through explicit memory gates, GRUs provide a lighter and faster alternative with similar expressiveness, and basic RNNs struggle with noisy and volatile series like Bitcoin returns.\nA clear pattern emerged when examining forecast behavior. While the actual BTC return series exhibits extreme spikes and large jumps, the deep learning models produce smoothed, mean-reverting forecasts. This reflects the effect of MSE loss, dropout regularization, and early stopping: the networks learn to avoid chasing high-variance noise and instead model the underlying conditional mean. This improves RMSE but limits the models’ ability to anticipate large shocks—an expected trade-off when forecasting highly volatile financial assets.\nCompared to ARIMA, the deep learning models demonstrated greater stability and better generalization on the validation set. ARIMA captured some short-term autocorrelation but could not adapt to nonlinear patterns or sudden regime shifts. Deep learning provided modest improvements in RMSE and produced cleaner forecasts, though these models remain limited in long-horizon accuracy. Overall, this comparison illustrates that deep learning can outperform classical models for noisy financial returns, but the choice of model depends on whether the goal is minimizing error, capturing shocks, or interpreting underlying structure."

Compared to the univariate models, all three architectures—RNN, GRU, and LSTM—achieved modest improvements in RMSE once SP500, NASDAQ, VIX, and the USD Index were incorporated as inputs. This suggests that Bitcoin’s short-term return dynamics contain weak but non-zero relationships with broader macro-financial factors, even though the asset remains highly volatile and partially decoupled from traditional markets.\nAmong the deep learning models, the GRU performed best (RMSE ≈ 0.714), followed closely by the LSTM (≈ 0.716). This mirrors the univariate results, reinforcing that gated recurrent architectures handle noisy, nonlinear return series more effectively than a basic RNN. GRUs remain computationally lighter while preserving the ability to capture temporal structure, which may explain their slight advantage. At the same time, the performance differences are small, indicating diminishing returns from additional complexity on this dataset.\nTraining and validation curves show stable learning behavior across all models: validation loss remains below or close to training loss, suggesting good generalization rather than overfitting. The flatter slopes in the multivariate models indicate that adding external predictors helps regularize the model by smoothing out purely idiosyncratic Bitcoin noise. However, the models still predict a highly dampened version of reality—small oscillations around zero—because daily Bitcoin returns are dominated by unpredictable shocks. MSE loss naturally penalizes large deviations, incentivizing the network to learn the conditional mean rather than the extremes.\nCompared to traditional multivariate models such as VAR or SARIMAX, the deep learning models demonstrate better adaptability to nonlinear patterns and interactions among predictors. Classical models struggle to capture sudden regime shifts, volatility clustering, and nonlinear dependencies that GRU/LSTM networks can approximate more effectively.\nOverall, this comparison highlights that multivariate deep learning improves short-term forecasting accuracy, but only incrementally. While the performance gains are meaningful, they do not overcome the inherent unpredictability of crypto-assets. If the goal is operational forecasting—such as risk monitoring or short-term directional bias—GRU or LSTM models offer the best balance of performance and stability. However, their ability to forecast large spikes or crashes remains limited, emphasizing that model choice should depend on the practical decision context rather than RMSE alone."

    "text": "Literature Review\n\nBackground and Variable Selection\nFinancial markets exhibit complex interdependencies that have evolved significantly with the emergence of cryptocurrency markets. According to Nakamoto (2008) and subsequent cryptocurrency research, Bitcoin was designed as a decentralized alternative to traditional fiat currencies. However, empirical studies by Baur & Dimpfl (2018) show that Bitcoin increasingly behaves like a traditional financial asset, responding to macroeconomic and market conditions.\nThe S&P 500 serves as a broad measure of U.S. equity market performance and overall economic health. Research by Corbet et al. (2018) demonstrates significant spillover effects between traditional equity markets and cryptocurrency markets, particularly during periods of market stress. During the COVID-19 pandemic, both Bitcoin and the S&P 500 experienced simultaneous crashes, suggesting increasing correlation.\nThe VIX (CBOE Volatility Index), often called the “fear gauge,” measures expected market volatility. Studies by Whaley (2009) establish the VIX as a leading indicator of market sentiment. Recent research by Smales (2019) shows that Bitcoin exhibits increased correlation with traditional markets during high-volatility periods, suggesting that market fear affects all asset classes. The inverse relationship between VIX and S&P 500 is well-documented, with VIX typically rising when stock prices fall.\nThe U.S. Dollar Index (USD) summarizes the value of the U.S. dollar against a basket of major currencies. Dollar strength is linked to global risk sentiment and capital flows. A stronger dollar is often associated with tighter global financial conditions and may put pressure on risky assets such as equities and cryptocurrencies.\nVariable Justification:\nBased on this literature, I focus on the following relationships:\n\nBitcoin returns may be influenced by traditional market performance (SP500) and market volatility/fear (VIX).\nSP500 and VIX have a well-documented inverse relationship—when stocks fall, fear rises.\nDollar strength (USD) may be related to risk sentiment and interact with equity and crypto markets.\nThese variables likely exhibit dynamic and possibly bidirectional relationships, motivating multivariate time series models."
