## What is a Time Series?

### Reference: Gamage, P. (2026). Applied Time Series for Data Science.

A time series is any sequence of measurements taken at regular, equally spaced intervals—seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, quarters, or years. Common examples include weather (daily temperature or rainfall), financial markets (daily stock prices or returns), industry indicators (monthly production or sales), electricity demand, traffic counts, and hospital admissions. In time-series analysis we study how these values evolve: their level, trend, seasonal or calendar patterns (e.g., weekdays vs. weekends, holiday effects), cycles, and anomalies. Typical goals are to describe behavior clearly, forecast future values, and quantify the impact of events or policies.

Because observations are ordered in time, nearby points tend to be correlated (autocorrelation). This violates the independent-and-identically-distributed assumption behind many standard statistical methods, so naïve cross-sectional tools often mislead. Time-series work must explicitly handle dependence, trend, and seasonality—for example by differencing, seasonal adjustment, and models that use lagged values and errors (e.g., ARIMA/SARIMA, ARIMAX/SARIMAX with external drivers, VAR for multiple series, state-space/ETS, or GARCH when volatility changes over time). Analysts also watch for structural breaks (e.g., policy shifts, COVID), outliers, and missing periods, and they evaluate models with time-aware validation (rolling or blocked splits) rather than random shuffles.


## Volatility Spillovers Across Asset Classes

Big Picture Goal

This project investigates how major financial markets interact, focusing on whether Bitcoin, the S&P 500, the VIX (fear index), and the U.S. Dollar Index influence each other’s returns and volatility. The goal is to understand whether crypto markets transmit risk to traditional finance or primarily react to it.

Analytical Framework

To answer the big-picture question, the analysis proceeds through four structured layers:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

I begin by examining long-term price trends, return distributions, rolling volatilities, and pairwise correlations across Bitcoin, S&P 500, NASDAQ, VIX, and USD.
Key diagnostic finding: Returns are stationary for all assets (post-differencing), but price levels are not.

2. Univariate Modeling (ARIMA / SARIMA)

Using daily returns, I estimate ARIMA models for each asset to capture their individual dynamics.

Findings:

BTC returns ≈ white noise with minimal predictability.

SP500 and NASDAQ exhibit stronger autocorrelation, supporting ARIMA(2,0,2) and ARIMA(4,0,3).

VIX is mean-reverting, best captured by ARIMA(3,0,1).

USD index behaves almost pure white noise.

These models serve as a benchmark for whether multivariate models add value.

3. Multivariate Modeling (ARIMAX Spillovers)

I then test for return spillovers by regressing each asset’s returns on the others:

Bitcoin is influenced by SP500 returns (positive) and VIX (slightly negative).

S&P 500 is significantly driven by VIX (strong negative effect) and lightly by Bitcoin.

VIX responds strongly to SP500 (negative), but barely to BTC.

USD shows no meaningful connection to BTC or SP500.

Forecast comparison shows that including other assets slightly improves accuracy, supporting mild cross-market influence.

4. Volatility Modeling (ARCH–GARCH)

To analyze volatility clustering:

SP500 volatility fits ARMA(2,1)–GARCH(2,1)
→ captures strong persistence and ARCH effects.

Bitcoin volatility fits ARMA(1,0)–GARCH(2,1)
→ weaker clustering but clear volatility persistence.

This framework identifies whether volatility in one market tends to spill into another.

5. Event Analysis (Interrupted Time Series – FTX Collapse)

Finally, I examine whether the FTX collapse created a structural break in Bitcoin behavior.

Result:

No statistically significant change in BTC return mean or trend after FTX.

BTC experienced short-term turbulence, but no long-run shift.

This suggests crypto markets absorb shocks quickly, with no persistent transformation in return behavior.
