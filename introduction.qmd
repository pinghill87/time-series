## Volatility Spillovers Across Asset Classes: Understanding Crypto–Market Interactions

This project investigates how major financial markets interact by examining return behavior, volatility persistence, and potential spillovers across Bitcoin, the S&P 500, the NASDAQ, the VIX, and the U.S. Dollar Index. The central goal is to understand whether cryptocurrency movements propagate into traditional markets, whether traditional markets influence crypto, and how these relationships behave around major events such as the FTX collapse.

Cryptocurrencies represent a new class of digital assets that trade 24/7, exhibit rapid price swings, and attract both speculative and institutional participation. In contrast, equity indices, volatility indices, and the dollar reflect more established, macro-driven financial structures. Understanding how these markets interact is fundamental for risk management, forecasting, and financial stability assessment.

This analysis goes beyond descriptive correlations by applying univariate time series models, multivariate ARIMAX regressions, volatility models (ARCH–GARCH), and an Interrupted Time Series (ITS) design to evaluate market dynamics before and after a major crypto shock. Together, these methods provide a structured framework for identifying market predictability, spillover mechanisms, and event-driven structural changes.


## Analytical Angles

This project is organized around five analytical angles that reflect the full modeling pipeline used in the analysis:


1. Market Co-Movement & Interdependence

This angle examines how major financial assets move together—whether trends, cycles, shocks, and volatility tend to align across Bitcoin, equities, volatility indexes, and currency markets. It frames the broader question of whether crypto behaves independently or increasingly integrates with traditional finance.

2. Short-Run Return Dynamics & Predictability

Here the focus is on identifying whether any asset exhibits meaningful short-term structure—autocorrelation, mean reversion, or drift—that could support forecasting. This angle evaluates how close each market is to “efficient,” noise-dominated behavior.

3. Cross-Market Influence & Spillovers

This perspective investigates whether movements in one asset help explain returns in another. For example, whether equity downturns spill into crypto, or whether volatility shocks propagate across asset classes. It captures directional influence and inter-market sensitivity.

4. Volatility Persistence & Risk Transmission

Instead of mean returns, this angle looks at the clustering and persistence of volatility, and whether periods of high instability in one market correspond to elevated risk in others. This highlights how shocks propagate even when returns themselves show little autocorrelation.

5. Structural Change & Shock Resilience

This perspective evaluates how markets respond to major events (e.g., the FTX collapse) and whether such shocks create lasting breaks in behavior. It helps determine whether crypto markets undergo regime shifts or quickly revert to their typical noisy patterns.

## Research Questions

The project addresses ten core questions spanning predictability, spillovers, volatility, and event dynamics:

**Market Structure & Predictability**

1. Are return series for BTC, SP500, NASDAQ, VIX, and USD stationary and suitable for time series modeling?
2. Which markets exhibit predictable dynamics, and which behave like white noise?

**Cross-Market Spillovers**

3. Do movements in the SP500 help explain Bitcoin's daily returns?
4. Does market stress (VIX) transmit into Bitcoin or equity returns?
5. Are return spillovers symmetric, or does one market dominate the relationship?

**Volatility Interactions**

6. Do Bitcoin and SP500 exhibit volatility clustering consistent with GARCH behavior?
7. How persistent are volatility shocks, and do persistence levels differ across assets?
8. Does including cross-market information improve volatility modeling or forecasting?

**Event-Driven Behavior**

9. Did the FTX collapse cause a statistically significant shift in Bitcoin's mean return or trend?
10. Did post-FTX volatility differ meaningfully from pre-event volatility?

These questions will guide our analysis and may evolve as findings emerge from exploratory data analysis and model estimation.

## Data Requirements

This project satisfies the course's data requirements by incorporating:

- **Seasonality considerations**: Analysis includes weekday vs. weekend behavior (crypto trades daily; equities do not)
- **Financial assets**: Crypto (BTC), equities (SP500, NASDAQ), volatility index (VIX), and macro indicator (USD Index)
- **Multiple univariate series**: All five assets serve as independent series used across analytical angles

# Literature Review: Volatility Spillovers Across Asset Classes

## Foundational Spillover Methodology and Traditional Markets

The measurement of volatility spillovers has been revolutionized by the  work of Diebold and Yilmaz (2012), who developed a generalized vector autoregressive framework in which forecast-error variance decompositions are invariant to variable ordering, enabling measures of both total and directional volatility spillovers. Their analysis of US stock, bond, foreign exchange, and commodities markets from 1999 to 2010 demonstrated that cross-market volatility spillovers were quite limited until the global financial crisis, which began in 2007, with particularly important spillovers from the stock market to other markets taking place after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. This methodology has been extended by Engle (2002) with Dynamic Conditional Correlation models for evolving correlations, and by Baruník and Křehlík (2018), who introduced frequency-domain analysis to distinguish between short-run trader-driven spillovers and long-run fundamental economic relationships. Recent methodological advances include Antonakakis and Gabauer (2017), who refined these measures to capture time-varying connectedness using TVP-VAR methods that provide more dynamic and sensitive connectedness measurements, particularly when relationships in the system do not remain constant over time.

## Cryptocurrency Integration and Cross-Market Spillovers

The emergence of cryptocurrency markets has fundamentally altered the landscape of financial spillovers, with mounting evidence of significant transmission effects to traditional asset classes. Recent studies demonstrate significant adverse volatility spillover effects from the cryptocurrency market to financial markets across various regions, including North America, South America, Europe, and Asia, with shocks originating in the cryptocurrency market negatively impacting stock markets, volatility indices, and foreign exchange rates globally. Research by the International Monetary Fund (2023) reveals that crypto assets predominantly transmit spillovers to financial markets, though reversals occur during periods of financial stress, with the magnitude of spillovers increasing during periods of heightened turbulence due to negative economic-financial news or crypto market events. The COVID-19 pandemic served as a natural experiment, with empirical analysis showing that the pandemic amplified volatility spillovers, thereby intensifying financial contagion between markets, indicating that the pandemic's impact on the economy heightened risk transmission across markets. Notably, recent Chinese market evidence from 2018-2024 shows that cryptocurrency price volatility causes stock market prices to fluctuate in the same direction while causing gold market prices to fluctuate in the opposite direction, challenging traditional safe-haven assumptions.

## Crisis Dynamics, Frequency Effects, and Research Gaps

The literature reveals that spillover relationships exhibit distinct patterns during crisis periods and across different time horizons, highlighting the importance of frequency-domain analysis and time-varying methodologies. Studies show that heightened crude oil volatility, stock volatility, and economic policy uncertainty contribute to more significant liquidity spillovers within cryptocurrency markets, with increased volatility in exchange rates, crude oil, gold, and stock markets enhancing Ethereum's role as a transmitter of liquidity shocks. Research using DCC-GARCH and wavelet analysis during COVID-19 demonstrates that volatility spillovers in cryptocurrency markets exhibit information inefficiency characteristics, with mutual linkages reflected through volatility co-movement, lead/lag effects, and systematic risk transmission. However, despite these advances, significant gaps remain in the literature. Most existing studies focus on either cryptocurrency-to-crypto spillovers or limited bilateral relationships with specific traditional assets, rather than comprehensive multi-asset class analysis. Additionally, research indicates that extreme fluctuations not predicted by current models are primarily caused by sudden external events, suggesting that existing methods are better suited for early warning of endogenous market volatility rather than exogenous shocks. This project addresses these gaps by providing a systematic analysis of directional spillovers across multiple asset classes while incorporating both crisis-period dynamics and frequency-decomposed effects to better understand the evolving role of cryptocurrencies in global financial stability.
